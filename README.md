# Getting started with [endeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) and [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/)

This guide is my attempt to share a distributable and recyclable setup without compromising the integrity of new users who might want to figure it out on their own, or do things their own way.

eOS is a lightweight distro that ships with a minimum amount of pre-installed apps.

A lot of my application choices are designed to work optimally with the i3 environment, enabling FULL user authority over just about everything, with a minimal and completely tunable UI/UX.

Choose i3-wm from the installer when prompted to choose a desktop environment, and be prepared to do some configuring.

If it seems too complicated for you, *it probably is!*
